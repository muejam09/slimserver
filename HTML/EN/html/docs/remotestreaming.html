<h2>Remote Streaming</h2>
<li>The Logitech Media Server was designed to stream audio files like mp3 or flac to a Slim Devices/Logitech Network Musik Player.<p> However, it can also stream the same files over the Internet to an MP3 software player such as VLC; Squeezelite and iTunes. </p></li>
<li>For the sake of discussion, the computer running the server will be called the remote machine.
<hr>
<h2>Now, use the following instructions:</h2>
 <p></p>
 <p>Open the stream called <a href="/stream.mp3">"http://localhost:9000/stream.mp3"</a> in your MP3
  software player. (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer.)
  This will inform the server that the software player is ready to receive a stream.</p>
 <p>Open the web interface of the server running on the remote computer by opening the web page <a href="/">"http://localhost:9000"</a> (Replace "localhost" with the IP address of the remote computer). You will notice
   a "player" corresponding to the IP address of the computer with the MP3 software player.</p>
 <p>Use the left pane of the server web interface to browse and select files and playlists. When music is selected, it will appear in the right pane of the web interface. </p>
 <p>Click on "Play" in the right pane of the server web interface to start the music.</p>
 <p>After a couple of seconds, you will hear music playing through the MP3 software player. (The delay is due to buffering in the MP3 player software.) </p>
 <p>If the MP3 Player did not start playing - please press the Play button on the MP3 Device again.</p>
 <p>To change the content playing, use the server on the remote machine.</p>
