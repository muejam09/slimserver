# slimserver
Server for Logitech Squeezebox players. This server is also called Logitech Media Server

This fork is used for building the Arch Linux PKGBUILDs available at 
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/logitechmediaserver/
and
https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/logitechmediaserver-git/

It excludes prebuilt CPAN Libraries and maybe some other components to reduce dowload size.
